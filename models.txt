STEP 1: BASAL METABOLIC RATE

    WOMEN   ->      BMR = 655.1 + 9.563 * WEIGHT IN KG + 1.85 * HEIGHT IN CM + 4.676 * AGE IN YEARS
    MEN     ->      BMR = 66.47 + 13.75 * WEIGHT IN KG + 5.003 * HEIGHT IN CM + 6.755 * AGE IN YEARS

STEP 2: ACTIVE METABOLIC RATE

    NONE        ->      AMR = BMR * 1.2
    LIGHT       ->      AMR = BMR * 1.375
    MODERATE    ->      AMR = BMR * 1.55
    ACTIVE      ->      AMR = BMR * 1.725
    INTENSE     ->      AMR = BMR * 1.9
